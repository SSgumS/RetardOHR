# RetardOHR
An online handwriting recognizer by words that is RETARD! Don't expect too much from it.

This model is just a sample to show how to use [POH-Db](https://github.com/SLTLabAUT/POH-Db).
It uses only WordGroup handwriting samples.
The attention decoder used in this model was based on the one referenced below that I partially upgraded it to TensorFlow 2.
Some parts of the code used for feature extraction is from the model referenced below.

The architecture used in this model is as the following picture:
